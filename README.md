# IFFCO Sahakar Udaan â€“ Drone Operations App

The **IFFCO Sahakar Udaan App** is a mobile application designed for drone operators to provide **spraying services for IFFCO Nano Fertilisers** at the farm level.  
Drone pilots can view farmer requests for spraying, process them, and track the status through the app.
